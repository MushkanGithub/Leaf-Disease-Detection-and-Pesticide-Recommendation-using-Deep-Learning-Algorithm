# Leaf-Disease-Detection-and-Pesticide-Recommendation-using-Deep-Learning-Algorithm
A system "Agrix" that extracts features from "PlantVillage" dataset of leaf images using Convolution Neural Networks and tensor flow technology to achieve some targets as follows.

Targets:-
1. Identify a leaf as healthy or diseased.
2. If diseased one, Agrix identifies leaf disease and informs about one of its possible causes and ways to prevent.
3. Further pesticide recommendation based on the identified fungi/bacteria/pest/virus for your plant curea and to resist spread.
4. Users can get suitable fertilizer recommendation based on the NPK content in soil.
5. Users can know the suitable crop to grow based on the NPK content, rainfall, pH level, current temperature and humidity of a particular region.
6. Users can now get all agro-related parametric updates in one place.
Our targeting crops are Bell Pepper, Tomato and Potato.The model detects diseases with 95.80% accuracy, benefiting cultivators.
